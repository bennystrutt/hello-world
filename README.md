# hello-world
This is a repository for practicing GitHub Flow

Starting this one for an assignment, but I can't tell for sure if it is the right one. Time will tell.
I'm an MLIS student just trying to make my way through an increasingly digital world. Learning some coding
feels like a good first step as we prepare for our AI overlords to inevitably assert their rule. 
Perhaps it makes me more helpful, but I do have concerns that they may see me as a threat as I hone my skills. 
If this readme is referenced in the eventual human loyalty tests that I assume will arrive by 2042, please know that this was just made to achieve the full score in my ISLT class.
